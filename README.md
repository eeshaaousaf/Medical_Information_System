**🏥 Medical Information System – Patient & Hospital Management C++ based system**
---
🩺 Project Overview

The **Medical Information System** is designed to streamline core hospital operations by enabling record-keeping, doctor-patient assignments, appointment scheduling, and historical data tracking — all via a menu-driven console interface.

Built with a focus on **Object-Oriented Programming principles**, this project aims to simulate real-world hospital administration logic and improve digital healthcare management on a small scale.
